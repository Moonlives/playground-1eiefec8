# Conclusion
Our journey together in the world of functional programming ends here, but there is a lot more to learn about this world, so here are my suggestions to continue exploring:  
- **You're still not convinced by this "functional programming" thing**  
    + Read the famous [Why Functional Programming Matters](https://www.cs.kent.ac.uk/people/staff/dat/miranda/whyfp90.pdf) paper  
- **You want to use functional programming in your future JS projects**  
    + I suggest you try out one (or more) of these libraries, that will make your life far easier: [lodash](https://lodash.com/), [ramda](http://ramdajs.com/), [underscore](http://underscorejs.org/)  
- **You fell in love with functional programming, and need something hardcore**  
    + Why not learning a purely function programming language? My suggestion is Haskell, and one great course is [learn you a haskell](http://learnyouahaskell.com/)  
- **You liked this playground very much and you want to contribute/clone it**
    + Here's the [github repo](https://github.com/ZaninAndrea/playground-przgjbPq)
